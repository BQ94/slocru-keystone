# Slocru Keystone
This is a rewrite of the Cru Central Coast website, using [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org), [`keystone.js`](http://keystonejs.com), and [`dust.js`](http://dustjs.com), among other things.

### Project Goals
- Use templating in some way, currently favoring `dust.js`
- Implement the `keystone.js` admin panel and wire it up to all of our databases, so that the web team and certain staff can have access.
- Migrate everything from PHP to make this all possible, of course
- New plan, possibly use [`taunus.js`](http://taunus.io)
